Here is a collection of writing and projects that document this website. I first started working on the site in October 2014 and have since worked on continually building, refining and adding to it.

## Principles

- Future-friendly
- Focused on content
- Economical, high performance design
- Progressively enhanced
- Flexible in layout and form
- Respectful of users and their devices
- Usable and accessible
- Empathetic in content, design and tone
{:.inline-list}

Publishing on my own site has given me personal freedom in working towards these goals, but these are principles that I attempt to incorporate into all of my creative work on the web.
