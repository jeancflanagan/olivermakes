  <h2>A new friend</h2>
  <p>On <time datetime="2014-10-06">October 6</time>, <a href="http://jeancflanagan.com">Jean</a> and I met and subsequently adopted a dog. We named her Sapphie after <a href="http://www.jagjaguwar.com/onesheet.php?cat=JAG019">a favorite album of mine by Richard Youngs</a>, which was dedicated to a dog he knew. She is a two-year-old rescue dog from North Carolina who was likely mistreated. She is warm and friendly, and she attached to us so quickly that she barely lets us leave the apartment without her. We hope to help our dog friend with her anxiety while she keeps us in good physical shape and teaches us to be kind to strangers.</p>
