use: 'Images that need to take up the full width of the body but not much more. Vertically oriented images are a good use case for this style. Contrast with [.image--narrow](#image-narrow)'
spec: 'Typically 50% width (wider on smaller screens), but this is somewhat layout-dependent. Contains an `<img>`. Figcaption is optional.'
