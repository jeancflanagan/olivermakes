  # Ancillary content

  Using a `capture` tag with Liquid allows one to encode Markdown text into an HTML block. One could use a Ruby plugin for Jekyll to process it, but that may be less effective.

<aside class="ancillary">
{{ page.include_markdown | markdownify }}
</aside>

Content flows after or around the `<aside>` block. The `.ancillary` block should be used for content that is related to the main body but not necessarily as important – supporting the main story without being directly a part of it. This paragraph represents the layout and style of main body content.
