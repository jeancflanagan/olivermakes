# Ancillary content

Using a `capture` tag with Liquid allows one to encode Markdown text into an HTML block. One could use a Ruby plugin for Jekyll to process it, but that may be less effective.
{% endcapture %}

<aside class="ancillary">
{{ ancillary | markdownify }}
</aside>

Content flows after or around the `<aside>` block. The `.ancillary` block should be used {{ page.use | downcase }} This paragraph represents the layout and style of main body content.
