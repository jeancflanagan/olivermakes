use: 'Images that need to take up the full width of the body but not much more. Vertically oriented photos are a good use case for this style. Contrast with [.image--wide](#image-wide)'
spec: 'Typically 100% width, but this is somewhat layout-dependent. Contains an `<img>`. Figcaption is optional.'
