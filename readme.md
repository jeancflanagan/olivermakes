# olivermak.es a website

## Goals

- Build a personal website as a home for my creative output.
- The site is an archive, not just a sequential blog. It will include writing and photos, but will not be limited to that.
- Experiment with HTML, CSS and design patterns that I have not implemented before.
- Showcase my work for friends, colleagues and potential collaborators and employers.
- Learn more about building advanced static sites with Jekyll.
- Initially, design and implement entirely by myself, with later feedback from others.

## Principles

- Future-friendly
- Responsive
- Content first
- Pattern second
- High performance
- Minimalism
- Progressive enhancement
- Respect for users and their devices
- Empathy in content, design and tone
- As a part of the broader web, the site should be designed as an archive

## Implementation

- Jekyll for building
- Amazon S3 for deploying and hosting
- TypeKit for fonts â€“ using three weights of [Ratio by p.s.type](http://cargocollective.com/pstype/Ratio)
- MapBox for maps
- Responsive images using `srcset` HTML specification
- No templates, pre-processors or boilerplate
- As little JavaScript as possible
