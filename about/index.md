### Design and development

I worked alone on this site for a few weeks in October and November 2014. I would like to thank [Jean](http://jeancflanagan.com) for input.

My process for designing the site mostly involves starting out with a handful of sketches, writing some notes and then diving into a text editor and browser to get it working. I have skipped mockups and high-fidelity compositions in favor of sketching, and then iterative HTML/CSS prototyping that can be worked into finished code as the project progresses. 

I target small-screens first (commonly known as “mobile-first”), so I make sure to test on a variety of devices as I go along. Working with fewer assumptions about device types informs the design process – it is easier to design with empathy and flexibilty with a responsive and iterative process.

### Typography

The fonts on the site (300, 400 and 500 weights of [the Ratio typeface](http://cargocollective.com/pstype/Ratio)) are [hosted by Typekit](https://typekit.com/colophons/hro5wuc). This site uses responsive typography based on pixel density, so if you have a higher resolution display, you will see different variants of Ratio.

## Copyright

All writing and photography on the site is my original work and is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 (CC BY-NC)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). All design and code is under conventional copyright (as opposed to CC-style “copyleft” copyright), but is available for fair use [on GitHub](https://github.com/opattison/olivermakes). If you are looking at the repository, almost everything in the `_static` and `_posts` folders is CC BY-NC and the most of the rest of it is under copyright, where applicable.

I designed the site myself, so most of the source was written by me by hand – exceptions where I derived inspiration or approach from another source are noted inline. An example of copyright violation would be copying all of the source code outright and using it to make a public website that could be confused for this one.

### Attribution

Proper CC BY-NC attribution with a link and credit would look like this:

> “The title” [Oliver Pattison](http://olivermak.es) CC BY-NC

Or in HTML:

{% highlight html %}
“The title” <a href="http://olivermak.es">Oliver Pattison</a> CC BY-NC
{% endhighlight %}

My open source code (including this site) is on **[GitHub](https://github.com/opattison)**.

I share some of my mobile photography to **[VSCO Grid](http://olivermakes.vsco.co)**.
