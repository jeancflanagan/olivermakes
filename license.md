All writing, photography, and other creative work on the site is my original content and is licensed under [{{ site.license.long }} ({{ site.license.short }})]({{ site.link.attribution }}){:rel="license"}. If you are looking at the repository, almost everything in the `_pages`, `_posts`, `icons`, and `images` folders is {{ site.license.short }}.

I designed the site myself, so most of the source was written by me. Exceptions where I derived inspiration or an approach from another source are noted inline. *All design and code* is [under the MIT license](#code), but is openly available for use [on GitHub]({{ site.link.source }}){:rel="source"}.

## Attribution for Creative Commons content

Proper {{ site.license.short }} attribution with a link and credit would look like:

**“The title” [Oliver Pattison]({{ site.url }}) [{{ site.license.short }}]({{ site.link.attribution }})**

Or in HTML:

```html
“The title” <a href="{{ site.url }}">Oliver Pattison</a> <a href="{{ site.link.attribution }}">{{ site.license.short }}</a>
```
